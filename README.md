DATA 698 Capstone Project - A Comparative Study of Deep Quantile Regression and Traditional Regression Models in stock price prediction

Stock price prediction plays a vital role in financial decision-making, assisting investors and institutions in managing risk and optimizing returns. Traditional regression models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Random Forest Regression, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) are widely used but are limited on predicting the conditional mean of stock returns. This approach fails to capture the uncertainty and asymmetry inherent in financial markets. 

To address these limitations, this capstone project explores the application of Deep Quantile Regression (DQR) for stock return prediction and evaluates its effectiveness relative to traditional regression models. DQR utilizes deep neural networks to estimate multiple conditional quantiles, allowing for the construction of prediction intervals that reflect a wider range of potential outcomes. Using historical stock data, the study compares DQR and traditional models in terms of predictive accuracy, robustness, and their ability to capture market uncertainty. The findings aim to support more informed and risk-aware investment strategies.
