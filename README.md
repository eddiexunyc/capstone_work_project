DATA 698 Capstone Project - A Comparative Study of Deep Quantile Regression and Traditional Regression Models in stock price prediction

Stock price prediction is very important in financial decision-making, assisting investors and institutions in managing risk and optimizing returns. Traditional regression models including Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, and Random Forest Regression are widely used but are limited on predicting the conditional mean of stock returns. This approach fails to capture the uncertainty and asymmetry inherent in financial markets. 

This capstone project explores the application of Deep Quantile Regression (DQR) for stock return prediction and evaluates its effectiveness relative to traditional regression models. DQR utilizes deep neural networks to estimate multiple conditional quantiles, allowing for a wider range of prediction intervals. The study compares DQR and traditional models in terms of predictive accuracy, robustness, and their ability to capture the market uncertainty, using evaluation metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Quantile Loss, and Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP). Results show that Polynomial and Random Forest Regression have a reasonable accuracy, it only provide the mean of stock price predictions where the Deep Quantile Regression provides the full distribution and performs very well at the tail end of the distribution.
